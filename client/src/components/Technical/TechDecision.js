              Each tab of the web app first shows a full-screen size image with
              some text on the image that explains either the purpose of the
              website or the purpose of the current page the user is on. I did
              this because I wanted to take advantage of the trend of
              full-screen background images in UI design. I incorporated some of
              Zappos’s color schemes from the Zappos website to include some
              similarities between the two sites. I put the fun facts in a
              carousel so the user can scroll through at either their own pace
              or the automated pace, while also keeping the layout clean. The
              picture in the carousel is purposefully lighter in color because I
              wanted to give a contrasting effect. I included the jokes in cards
              that are collapsible so the user can try to guess the answer to
              the joke first before viewing the answer. In the about me page, I
              wanted to give a little more information than what was on my
              resume by stating my passions and drive to become a better
              front-end developer. I wanted to display my work experience in a
              systematic way that includes the dates and details, so I used a
              timeline to let the user know more about my work experience. I
              included mobile responsive styles to allow the user to be able to
              view my website at any point in the day, whether it is on their
              phone, tablet, or computer.
