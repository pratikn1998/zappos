I was responsible for the design of the UPS Developer Portal. I also helped increase customer outreach by developing a Web App that allows customers to submit insurance claims directly online. I was responsible for the front-end development on this app and used Angular 7 throughout the project. I competed in the UPS Hackathon and developed an Android App that served two purposes. The first to minimize the number of misdelivered packages by using photo metadata and using reverse geocoding with the Google Maps API to verify that the package was dropped off at the correct location. The second purpose was to allow customers to view the location of their package in Google or Apple Maps. My results from this Hackathon was that I won Best Overall and Best Presentation. I was able to use software like Zeppelin that helped me design the web app as close as possible to the UI mockups that UX designer provided. Throughout the summer, I also practiced Agile and Scrum methodologies by participating in daily standups and using Microsoft TFS, which is a project management and collaborative software development tool.</p>\n                        <p>Two summers ago, I was able to combine my passions for Technology and Business. I was the Cofounder of a startup that was part of Georgia Tech’s Create-X program. The Create-X program is a startup accelerator that provides funding and mentoring to student led companies. I was responsible for front end design and Customer outreach. I gained a lot of experience from my time with the startup both technical and business. I was able to gauge feature and product specifications by talking to over 200 teachers that summer to understand the problems they face and the features they might want. In my time, I was able to understand what drives a business and how to adapt to certain challenges and situations that rise. </p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>  \n        </div>\n        <div id=\"pratikfrontendreason\">\n            <h2>Front-End Development and Why I love it</h2>\n        </div>\n        <div id =\"pratikexperience\">\n            <div className=\"container\">\n                <h2><u>Experience</u></h2>\n                <div className=\"pratikexptimelinesection\">\n                    <div className =\"pratikexpicon\">\n                    <i className=\"fas fa-map-pin fa-2x mt-2\"></i>\n                    </div>\n                    <span className=\"pratikexptimelinedate\">May 2019 - August 2019</span>\n                    <div className=\"pratikexptimelinecontent\">\n                        <h3>UPS Capital</h3>\n                        <h4>IT Programmer Intern</h4>\n                        <p>- Increased customer outreach by developing a Web App that allows customers to submit insurance claims directly online</p>\n                        <p>- Developed the UPS API developer portal using Azure</p>\n                        <p>- Engaged with managers and various code owners to design and develop a robust implementation of internship project</p>\n                        <p>- Worked in a collaborative team environment of 7 developers using many Agile and Scrum methodologies\n</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"pratikexptimelinesection\">\n                    <div className =\"pratikexpicon\">\n                    <i className=\"fas fa-map-pin fa-2x mt-2\"></i>\n                    </div>\n                    <span className=\"pratikexptimelinedate\">Jan 2018 - August 2018</span>\n                    <div className=\"pratikexptimelinecontent\">\n                        <h3>Corbii</h3>\n                        <h4>Co-Founder/Developer</h4>\n                        <p>- Used Angular to develop a website that utilizes cognitive science to improve a student’s long-term retention of information</p>\n                        <p>- Managed a $20,000 budget given from Georgia Tech’s Create-X program</p>\n                        <p>- Met and discussed with over 200 teachers to help plan feature and product specifications</p>\n                        <p>- Built Client Relations by encouraging teachers to use the Beta version of Corbii</p>\n                        <p>- Led Market Strategy and Consumer Outreach</p>\n                        <p>- 1 of 30 startups to deliver pitch at Fox Theatre to potential investors</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"pratikeducation\">\n            <h2><u>Education</u></h2>\n            <div className=\"pratikeducationitem\">\n                <h3>Georgia Institute of Technology <span>August 2017 - Present</span></h3>\n                <h4>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</h4>\n                <p>\n                    Threads: Intelligence and People\n                    <br/>\n                    Relevant Courses: \n                    <br/>\n                    - Intro to Computing\n                    <br/>\n                    - Intro to Object-Oriented Programming\n                    <br/>\n                    - Data Structures and Algorithms\n                    <br/>\n                    - Objects and Design\n                    <br/>\n                    - Computer Organization and Programming\n                    <br/>\n                    - Intro to Artificial Intelligence\n                    <br/>\n                    - Design and Analysis of Algorithms\n                </p>\n             \n            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div id=\"pratikskills\">\n            <h2>Skills/Languages</h2>\n            <ul>\n                <li>Java</li>\n                <li>Javascript</li>\n                <li>Python</li>\n                <li>Swift</li>\n                <li>Node</li>\n                <li>Angular</li>\n                <li>React</li>\n                <li>Android</li>\n            </ul>\n        </div>\n        </Fragment>\n       \n    );\n}\n\nexport default AboutPratik;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
